# Machine-Learning-Based-Event-Identification-in-power-system.


## Steps of development

- Acquisition and Preprocessing of PMU(Phasor Measurement Unit) data.
– Application of Decomposition Techniques like SVD(Single Value Decomposition) and Signal Processing Techniques
  like (EMD)Empirical Mode Decomposition with Hilbert Transform, and other Feature Engineering Principles.
– ML(Random Forest) Application for better event identification.
– Saved the trained model and scaler, used for feature normalisation.
– Tested the saved model on other IEEE systems and analysed the results.
